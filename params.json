I have stored over 15000 tweets on to mongodb. The program for storing public tweet that I have wrote can be found here\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/kailashjoshi/twitter-mongodb\r\n```\r\nThe data that I have collected for mongodb can be downloaded from\r\n```\r\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/91258003/Obama.zip\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Pre-requisite for running this program\r\n\r\n```\r\n1. Install Mongodb and start mongodb with the data downloaded from above\r\n   For example ./mongod --dbpath data/db\r\n2. Install Hadoop cluster for running MapReduce Job and start the cluster\r\n3. Install Spring Tool Suite because the program is written on Spring Data\r\n4. Install Maven\r\n```\r\n## Steps for running the program\r\n\r\n```\r\n1. Download the source\r\n2. Unzip the folder and open a java class Classify.java\r\n3. Edit the path of classifier.txt file (Save and close the file)\r\n4. Go to the download source folder from your terminal window\r\n5. Run maven command \" mvn clean compile package\"\r\n6. Open Spring Tool Suite and import the project\r\n7. Run the project\r\n```\r\n***","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
